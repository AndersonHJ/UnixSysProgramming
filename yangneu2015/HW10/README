GOALS: Experiment application fault tolerance.

STEPS:
1.Open two VM as apache servers and install php5, and then create index.php file for each of them.
2.Open VM as balancer and set the configuration file to make it connect to servers created before.
3.Open VM as client to run a shell file which is a loop of curl so that it could continue connecting the balancer.
4.Restart one of the servers to see what whill happen.
5.Open another VM as the third server and change configuration file of balancer to make it connect to all the servers.
6.Run the shell file from client again.
7.Restart one of the servers to see what will happen.

RESULT:
1.When I run loader, it will connect to server1 and server2 alternately. Once I restart one of the server, sometimes
  it will report “Proxy Error” and then continue to connect to two servers alternately; sometimes it will not report
  anything, but just keep connecting to the other server and will never connect to the server which has restarted
  before until I restart the balancer.
2.When I add the third server to balancer, and run loader, it will connect to the three servers alternately. Once
  I restart one of the server, sometimes it will report “Proxy Error” and then continue to connect to two servers
  alternately; sometimes nothing will happen and the loader will keep running smoothly and successfully.

Conclusion:
Three-server system is absolutely more stable than two-server system. In two-server system sometimes the server will be
unavailable if it restarts unless I restart balancer, while in three-server system this situation never happens.
