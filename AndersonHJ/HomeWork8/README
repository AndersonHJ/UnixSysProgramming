balancer : http://52.36.84.112

Balcancer will forward request to server1 and server2 alternately.

serve1 : http://52.38.2.102 

server2 : http://52.36.105.142 

server1 and server2 both has a index.php in the directory /var/www/html.
The client will access the index.php then get the response from server.


client will send request to balancer, and get the response from server1 or server2
sh request.sh : script file will send http request every one second.

When I run the script in a client window, the usage of cpu of server is about 23%,
then I open more windows to run the script, the usage rate of cpu increased to 89.9%.
