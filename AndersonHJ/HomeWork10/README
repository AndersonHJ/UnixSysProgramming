balancer public IP: http://52.38.123.237

Balcancer will forward request to server1 and server2 and server3 alternately.

server1 private IP: http://172.31.32.110 

server2 private IP: http://172.31.45.93

server3 private IP: http://172.31.39.176

server1, server2 and server3 all has the msgsrv application and load-engima.
The client will access the load.php then get the response from server.
The load.php will load the CPU. The client will run a script like a while loop of curl to load the server.



client will send request to balancer, and get the response from server1 or server2
sh request.sh : script file will send http request every one second.

When I run the script in a client window, the usage of cpu of server is about 6%,
then I open more windows to run the script.

We use the command 'sudo netstat -anp | grep apache2 | wc -l' to get the number of connections to apache2.

We use the log file 'access.log' to calculate the access number every minute on one server.

This is the record of usage of cpu, memory and connection on the server
