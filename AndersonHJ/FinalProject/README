LAMP is an archetypal model of web service solution stacks, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components: the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), and the PHP. The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original selection. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

Launch a VM: Because our website is just in the beginning, we choose t2.mirco. Just login to aws.amazon.com, sign in to the console, choose EC2 service, click "Launch instance", and choose ubuntu. Although there is no significantly difference between those servers, load balancer and database server, we have make a plan in our future usage. We will use t2.xlarge model as the load balancer, with the configuration:vCPU 4, Mem 30.5GiB, storage 800 SSD. For the database server, we choose d2.xlarge model, with the configuration: vCPU 4, Mem 30.5, Storage 3*2000 HDD.
